About
-----
Compound Collider Generator (CCG) is a tool that makes creation of collider meshes for complex,
concave shapes easier. Using the Unity feature of Compound Colliders, CCG automatically creates
child objects with Collider components on your selected GameObject.

Compound colliders allow you to create concave collision meshes for your dynamic Rigidbody
objects, a feature not possible when using concave MeshColliders. Compound colliders also
typically give better performance than MeshCollider objects and better reliability.

Currently CCG can create compound collider shapes for:
	- Rings
	- Barrels
	- Bowls / Bubbles
	- Open Boxes

For additional information on Unity's Compound Colliders feature, see the official Unity Manual:
