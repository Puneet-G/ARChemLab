# The ARChemLab
No student's education should be limited by their circumstance or environment.
We made the Augmented Reality Chemistry Laboratory to see if students could get practical science education, without the resources, insfrastructure or risk that a real-world laboratory brings.

Snippets of our demo are below and the [complete demo is on youtube!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeYEj6O6RxI "ARChemLab")
